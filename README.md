# MAX7219-4in1-DHT11
Att: Nick Gammon, Ralph Bacon,John Main
This Arduino Circuit consisting of the MAX7219 4in1 display and  DHT11 sensor, was made to produce scrolling text on Temperature, Humidity, Heat Index and Dew Point Temperature.  
The scrollinig works fine for fixed Temperaure & Humidity values but update on the temperature and humidity do not occur. Contributions most welcomed.
